a) Discuss the advantages of SSDs over other object detection methods
such as YOLO and Faster R-CNNs for real-time applications.

b) Design a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture for
generating realistic images of handwritten digits. Specify the generator
and discriminator networks, including their layer configurations,
activation functions, and loss functions.

c) Outline the architecture and training procedure of the Wasserstein GAN
(WGAN) and compare its performance with traditional GANs.

10. a) Differentiate between YOLO (You Only Look Once) and other object
detection methods like Faster R-CNN in terms of speed and accuracy.

b) Investigate the role of sparsity in sparse autoencoders and discuss how
it contributes to feature learning and dimensionality reduction compared
to traditional autoencoders.

c) How does a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) differ from traditional
discriminative models in terms of their approach to learning?
