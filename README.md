# Tbman - Fast and Easy Memory Manager

## What it is
Tbman is a general-purpose memory manager offering (among others) these functions 

`tbman_malloc, tbman_free, tbman_realloc`,

which can replace corresponding stdlib functions

`malloc, free, realloc`,

in C and C++ code.

## Benefits
* Generally faster than stdlib functions. [*You can quickly verify this yourself.*](#anchor_quick_evaluation)
* Automatic alignment even for extended data types. *(E.g. SIMD types such as `int32x4_t`)*
* Reduced fragmentation of system memory.
* Easy monitoring of total memory usage. *(E.g. for leak detection)*
* Optional communicaton of actually granted amounts. *(Useful for dynamic arrays)*
* Platform independence: 
   * The code adheres to the c11-standard.
   * It can be built on any platform satisfying the [build requirements](#anchor_build_requirements) below.
   * It has been tested on Intel and ARM platforms.

## How to use it
* `git clone https://github.com/johsteffens/tbman.git`

**Linux (or operating systems supporting POSIX):** Just follow suggestions below.

**Windows:** [Set up a POSIX-environment first](https://github.com/johsteffens/beth/wiki/Requirements#how-to-setup-a-posix-environment-for-beth-on-windows). 

### Requirements/Dependencies
   * gcc (or similar compiler suite) supporting the C11 standard.
   * Library `pthread` of the POSIX.1c standard.

**Quick evaluation**:

`eval.c` is an evaluation program simulating realistic runtime conditions for a memory manager. It verifies correct functionality and assesses the processing speed. It compares the performance of stdlib functions with tbman functions. You can quickly run it yourself:
   * Enter folder with source files and run: `gcc -std=c11 -O3 btree.c tbman.c eval.c -lm -lpthread; ./a.out`

**In your workspace:**
* Compile `tbman.c` and `btree.c` (either among your source files or into a static library)
* In your code: 
  * `#include "tbman.h"`
  * Call once `tbman_open();` at the beginning or your program. *(E.g. first in `main()`)*
  * Use `tbman_*` - functions anywhere. 
    <br><sub>Note: Do not mix stdlib and tbman alloc-functions for the same memory instance.</sub>
  * Call once `tbman_close();` at the end or your program. *(E.g. last in `main()`)*

<a name="anchor_build_requirements"></a>
**Build requirements:**
* Your C-compiler should support the C11 standard: `-std=c11`
* Tbman uses the pthread library: `-lpthread`

**C++:**

You can use tbman in C++ code as follows:
* Include tbman.h as C-header:<br>
  ```C++
  extern "C"
  {
     #include "tbman.h"
  }
  ```
* In object oriented C++ programming, the direct use of `malloc`, `realloc` or `free` is discouraged in favor of using operators `new` and `delete`, which take care of object construction/destruction. However, you can overload these operators, taking control over the part concerned with memory allocation.<br>
**Example:**
    ```C++
    void* operator new( size_t size ) { return tbman_malloc( size ); }
    void operator detete( void* p ) { tbman_free( p ); }
    ```
    Here is a nice external article about overloading allocation operators:<br>

## How it works
Tbman uses a "conservative" memory pooling approach with multiple token-based fixed size block-managers at a strategic size-distribution. It pre-allocates only moderate amounts of memory and dymatically acquires more or releases back to the system as needed and/or suitable. Multiple pools are managed in a btree.

For large memory requests, where pooling would be wasteful, tbman falls back to using direct system calls. However, it keeps track of all memory.

### Use in multi-threaded applications
Tbman is thread safe: The interface functions can be called any time from any thread simultaneously. Memory allocated in one thread can be freed in any other thread.

Concurrency is governed by a mutex. This means that memory management is not lock free. Normally, this will not significantly affect processing speed for typical multi threaded programs. Only during heavvy simultaneous manager usage lock-contention time might be noticeable compared to single threaded usage.

## Motivation
This memory manager has been conceived and developed for the project [beth](https://github.com/johsteffens/beth). It has reached sufficient maturity for general purpose and platform independent usage. We therefore created the spin-off-project [tbman](https://github.com/johsteffens/tbman) where the manager is offered as compact stand-alone solution.



Thanks for reading. I hope you will find it useful.
